In this repo we have 6 folders. Each one with a different exercise. The goal is to learn a few things about testing.
1. Simple FizzBuzz exercise in python and pytest
2. Continuation of FizzBuzz with python and pytest. Example to understand the benefits of testing
3. An api endpoint in fastapi. Helps to understand how testing apis requires you to understand the framework.
4. Testing two api endpoints. One requires mocking dates, another one mocking the database.
5. Testing components and interactions in a frontend application with vue, vitest and testing library.
6. Testing end2end with cypress

## Instructions
Each exercise has its own instructions.
